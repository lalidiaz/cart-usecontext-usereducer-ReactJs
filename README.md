# cart-usecontext-usereducer-ReactJs

This is the 14th project to refresh ReactJs concepts. I am writing an article about ReactJs main concepts so I can share it with the community once it's finished.
This is a shopping cart, the price would increase or decrease if you add or remove items. Also, you can clear the list.
Topic:

â€¢ useContext() and useReducer() hooks, contextAPI, fetch data with useReducer().
